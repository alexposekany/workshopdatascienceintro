# Workshop for Introduction to Data Science

## Data Exploration

**Data exploration** is about getting to know the data through *visualisations* and *descriptive statistics* (arithmetic mean, median are prominent examples). 

You find the presentation for the data exploration part [here](https://github.com/alexposekany/workshopdatascienceintro/blob/main/DataVisualisationExploration_workshop_short.pdf)

In addition you find the links to the two examples where you can try out data exploration yourself:

## Data Modelling 

Creating models based on data has two main goals: 
- learning relations between the variables in the models and their structure
- predicting future data based on previous one

In **Machine Learning** these approaches are often split dependent on the amount of knowledge and data available on the process you wish to learn about or predict:
- *supervised learning* (all outcomes are already know for training the algorithm)
- *semi-supervised learning* (some outcomes are already know for training the algorithm, other training data or validation data have no outcomes known in advance)
- *unsupervised learning* (what is to be learned be the algorithm is not available as previous data, because it is unknown, unmeasurable etc.)
